* Identify

  Given a list of "pattern lines", like

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     ['GGGLGLG',
      'GLGGGGGLGLGGLGL',
      'GGGGGLGG',
      'LGGGGGGLLGGLGL']
     #+END_EXAMPLE

   we can divide it into several "parts":

   - the whole verse
   - halves of verses, by lines
   - halves of verses, by number of syllables
   - quarters of verses, by lines
   - quarters of verses, by number of syllables
   - individual lines in the verses
