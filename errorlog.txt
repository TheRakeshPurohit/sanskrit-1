    I've decided to use this file to record changes I *intend* to
    make, before making them. The hope is that by describing them
    beforehand, I'll be able to think more clearly.
    As of now, I can think of multiple directions / changes:

    1. Expand the inventory of metres. The code has recently been
       cleaned up to make the metrical data cleaner, except the most
       common metres, Anuṣṭup and Āryā (and mātra metres in general).
       So it should be ready to incorporate the big lists compiled by
       Dhaval and Vishvas.

    2. Just figured out a good way to handle the display of syllables.
       As every syllable contains exactly one vowel, syllables are in
       1:1 correspondence with the vowels. So for the sake of display,
       we can syllabize any way at all (e.g. retain the spaces in the
       original, for one), and just mark the syllables from the
       pattern after the fact. There is no need to pass the actual
       syllables through the identifier; we can re-syllabize at
       display time.
       At display we can play with divs and CSS, or something —
       retaining the spaces in the original, so that the verse is
       readable.

    3. Currently we attempt to identify the entire pattern, and also
       each line in the input. We can additionally break the pattern
       at half and quarter boundaries, to increase recognition.

    As exciting as (2) is, (3) seems the simplest change, so let me
    try that first.

    Done 3. The abstraction of
        input --(read)--> slp1 --(scan)--> pattern --(identify)--> metres
    has been really helpful in keeping the code clean.

    The last "display" step can be one of "aligning" a potential metre to the
    input.

    So perhaps we don't need all the "issues" in MatchResult. All we need to
    know is whether we got a perfect match for the whole verse, or not. If not,
    then the aligning step will handle the mismatch.

    Got rid of "issues".
