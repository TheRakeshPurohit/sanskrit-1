    I've decided to use this file to record changes I *intend* to
    make, before making them. The hope is that by describing them
    beforehand, I'll be able to think more clearly.
    As of now, I can think of multiple directions / changes:

    1. Expand the inventory of metres. The code has recently been
       cleaned up to make the metrical data cleaner, except the most
       common metres, Anuṣṭup and Āryā (and mātra metres in general).
       So it should be ready to incorporate the big lists compiled by
       Dhaval and Vishvas.

    2. Just figured out a good way to handle the display of syllables.
       As every syllable contains exactly one vowel, syllables are in
       1:1 correspondence with the vowels. So for the sake of display,
       we can syllabize any way at all (e.g. retain the spaces in the
       original, for one), and just mark the syllables from the
       pattern after the fact. There is no need to pass the actual
       syllables through the identifier; we can re-syllabize at
       display time.
       At display we can play with divs and CSS, or something —
       retaining the spaces in the original, so that the verse is
       readable.

    3. Currently we attempt to identify the entire pattern, and also
       each line in the input. We can additionally break the pattern
       at half and quarter boundaries, to increase recognition.

    As exciting as (2) is, (3) seems the simplest change, so let me
    try that first.

    Done 3. The abstraction of
        input --(read)--> slp1 --(scan)--> pattern --(identify)--> metres
    has been really helpful in keeping the code clean.

    The last "display" step can be one of "aligning" a potential metre to the
    input.

    So perhaps we don't need all the "issues" in MatchResult. All we need to
    know is whether we got a perfect match for the whole verse, or not. If not,
    then the aligning step will handle the mismatch.

    Got rid of "issues".

    Seems to be in a reasonably OK state again, next it remains to handle the
    alignment problem.


2014 May.

    This "literate programming" thing doesn't seem to be working; I have to
    remember to edit this file. Anyway, so far:

    * scan.py doesn't need to keep track of the original syllables; we'll have a
      separate "display" later that redoes this.

    * made identifier.py try all possible breaks into quarters

    * Coded up a dynamic-programming alignment of the verse's metrical pattern,
      and the metre's known metrical pattern. (See display._Align().)

    * Keep spaces in the transliteration. This allows us to prefer syllable
      breaks at word boundaries.

    * Formatting the alignment in HTML, using <span>s and some styling.

    * Wrote a program to incorporate Dhaval's lists.
      After going over just the shorter list, found some issues:

        - [Not a bug] Metres ending in laghu, like samānikā (GLGLGLGL = trochaic
          tetrametre), mauktidadāma (LGLLGLLGLLGL = 4 ja-ganas = amphibrachic
          tetrametre), vṛtta (GLGLGLGLGLGLGLGLGLGL = trochaic decametre),
          yavātparāmatīya (GLGLGLGLGLGL = trochaic hexameter). Need to look at
          examples of actual usage, to confirm whether they actually end even
          the sama-padas with laghu, or use guru there (in which case I can make
          these ardha-sama-vrttas).
        - Oh actually, yavātparāmatīya is already ardhasama as expected. Let me
          remove that check. (Done.)

        - Duplicates: Two metres named śrī? rukmavatī = campakamālā? upasthita =
          śikhaṇḍita? pramuditavadanā = prabhā? śaśikalā = maṇiguṇanikara =
          mālā? narkuṭaka = kokilaka? Is padacaturūrdhva a metre worth noting?

    * We need to figure out a "related metres" info: e.g. there seems to be a
      upacitrā-dodhaka-drutamadhyā-vegavatī-hariṇaplutā-Drutavilambitam complex
      with various sorts of overlap. No point showing an overly specific metre;
      better to say how it relates to more famous ones.

    - Resolved conflicts in big list from Heidelberg too. (Next stop V's list.)
    - Added a lot of logging to detect conflicts (then later removed it).
    - Even looser Arya: occasionally even odd-numbered lines had only 11 mātras
      and needed the last L to be interpreted as G.
    - Red colour in HTML alignment, for errant syllables.
    - Devanagari version of the metre name too, in results.
    - Code cleanup

    Instead of returning a match_result.MatchResult object from identifier,
    simply return a string. After all, even if it's only one line of four that
    matches, it's still not right to say that the match type is a pāda. The
    matches can be ranked by the aligner.

    Found some clear constraints on Āryā.
